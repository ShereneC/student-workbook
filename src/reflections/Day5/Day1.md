# Uno Dia - Environment Setup

Today's Reflection: As we set up our coding environments today, I became overwhelmed that in the future, I may not know how to get set up again, because this isn't something you do on a regular basis.  Mark assured us that as a junior developer, the senior developer at our future job would be able to help us get set up and running.


## In your own words, why do we use Git? 
### Git is a place to store code where it can be made live and a record of versions is kept.  Team members can all access the code.

## What are the benefits of having multiple branches?
### Team members can work on different parts of the code simultaneously?  You can also test out alterations in a test branch, then merge it back when you feel it is ready.

## What is the difference between Git and GitHub? 
### Git is the system, GitHub is the web address where it is located for our use?

Afternoon Code: None today
