# Uno Dia - Intro to NodeJS

Today's Reflection: 
Most of today's lecture, I did not understand.  We were given a new template to use which utilizes something called node.  We are now using more files and folders than ever.  Mark went through a lot of files that we don't need to be able to interpret all the code for, but they are important for code now working.  In class, he made a program called Knights and demonstrated how to use the new template to:
getAll (from the database)
getById
Put (edit)
Post (add a new one)
Delete (remove one (by id))
We were introduced to POSTMAN which is a fake client program to test our code.

## What is the purpose of a Query String?
### Tells a website what data you are trying to access by appending the base url.

## What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?
### The query starts after the question mark and multiple queries are separated by ampersands. 

## When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?
### Parameters could be helpful in identifying certain properties or grouping them together into arrays of like requests.
