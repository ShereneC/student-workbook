# UnderStanding Asynchronous Code, and API's

**1.** What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Asynchronous means that a function might take longer to complete than the one below it, but the program can still move on with the code while waiting for the first function to complete. Synchronous code goes in order step by step.
