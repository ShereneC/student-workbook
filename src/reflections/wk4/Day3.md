# Tres Dia WORKING WITH MULTIPLE API'S

Today's Reflection: Today we made the Pokeman list website using two api's.  One api was our own, one was the pokemon api.  We were to "get" the pokemon's from the already built api and store some of them in our own api.  I am struggling with the concept of id - because each api has an id, but they are different.  I am not sure how to use the id to delete the objects.  Mark said to use a unique property in each api, but I don't really understand what.
Concepts:
Getting from an api
Two api's 
Api's give you information in different ways
Posting to an api
Displaying api information in a card on the DOM

**I did not complete the project - I had an hour of tutoring with Justin today. We went over the flow of information in the MVC model and using the checkbox/checked attribute.  I attempted to get the checked attribute working in my TaskMaster project, but it is still not working.  I inserted the toggle function and the ternary on the task.js file.  

## What is the purpose of Async/Await?

### Let's the code know you are requesting information from a server and you need to await the results.

## What must you do in order to await a promise inside of a function?
### put async before the function name

## What are some of the primary benefits of Async/Await?

### It makes the code look like it is synchronous even though it is not - which makes degugging easier.
