# Cinco Dia Inspire Checkpoint

Today's Reflection: When things aren't working with my code, I fear that there are a million things written incorrectly.  But when I ask the TA's for help, there are only small problems here and there.  I hope I can become more confident in my code.  This checkpoint is worth two points and it is difficult.  I was only able to get the Todo list working with the api in class today.  I will have to do all the rest on my own this weekend.
