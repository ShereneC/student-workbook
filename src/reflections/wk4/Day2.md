# Dos Dia - HTTP REQUESTS CONTINUED

Today's Reflection: Today we returned to Greg's List and created the lists of cars and houses from the api.  I was able to get through the whole process of adding the api with the houses.  We created a bidding button and were able to change the price not only locally, but on the api site as well.  PROBLEM:  Both sites from today and yesterday are not showing the api information on the live site - only on the local site.  Need to figure out why.

## What are the three states of a Promise?

### Pending, Resolved, Rejected

## How do promises seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

### Promises will never leave the code waiting for a callback.  If something doesn't return after a certain amount of time, the promise will let you know so that you can move on.  

## What is the difference between .then() and .catch()? 

###  .then is what happens in the code if the promise is resolved. .catch happens if the promise is rejected.
