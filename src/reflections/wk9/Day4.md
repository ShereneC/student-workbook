# Cuatro Dia - Capstones

Today's Reflection:  We have small bits and pieces that need worked on today, we all took a different thing to work on.  I worked on the functions for displaying how long a plant has been in the garden, and when the user should plan on harvesting it.  I was scared of figuring this out at first, but I found some helpful websites on comparing two dates/times.  I compared the createdAt against the date.now to make the function.  

## What is an SSL certificate?

### "SSL certificates are a small data files that cryptographically establish an encrypted link between a web server and a browser. This link ensures that all data passed between the web server and browser remain private."

## What are the different types of certificates? What are they used for?

### Extended Validated - shows the padlock - most expensive; Organization Validated- verifies that it's real, medium level; Domain Validation - green padlock, low-level, quickest you can get; Wildcard - can be used on domain and subdomains; Unified Communications - can be used on multiple domains; Single Domain - can only be used on one domain.

## What are some benefits of using SSL certificates?

### You can have a more trusted site, as well as a slight boost in google's search algorithm.
