# Uno Dia - Capstones

Today's Reflection: CJ and I are working on the POsts and comments today.  The backend is mostly done and we have tested it all with postman, so we will start working on the frontend today.  Things seem to be working well.  We are going slow, but everything is coming together.

## What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
### We are using node.js and vue. For the first time, we have a many to many relationship between the garden and plants.  We are utilizing a weather api and an article api.  

## What went well so far?
### We are working really well together and working hard.  This has been a great team for me.

## What would you do differently? Why?
###  Plants in the garden!! There must be a way to get them by garden id instead of creator id - I would like to have more time to do that right!
