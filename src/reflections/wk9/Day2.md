# Dos Dia - Capstones

Today's Reflection: Working hard on our GreenThumb capstone project.  Had some difficulties getting the plants to show up in the garden.  It seems like we should be able to get them by the garden Id, but we ended up using the creator Id (we had to get help from the TA's.)  But the problem with that is that if you have more than one garden - which we wanted to have in order to have a many to many relationship- the plants from one garden show up in the other because of the creatorID, so I am not happy about the way we did that part of the code. 

## What is a Github action and how do they work?

### You can put up to 20 workflow files on a github, they can do things like notify you when someone stars your project, or send you an email when there is a push.  

## What benefits do Github actions provide?

### They can monitor the code and do things automatically for you that otherwise you would have to remember to do, and take the time to  do.

## What types of trigger actions can a workflow use? What do they do?

### Workflow reacts to a push, pull or fork.  Webhooks are actions that github performs, like when a project is starred.
