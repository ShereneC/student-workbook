# Cinco Dia - Hackathon

Today's Reflection: We got our product completed today - well, it has some bugs that we are working on, but it is mostly done.  It looks nice, it functions well, but under the hood there is some refactoring that should be done.  We certainly can't get things done without help from everyone, but with everyone working on different parts, there are some messy things in the code here and there.  But I am proud of the work we did.
