# Tres Dia Capstones

Today's Reflection: John and I are finishing up the my garden page today.  Still not happy about the plants being found by creator id, but we need to move on.  

## How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?

### You might need to widen the scope of your communication on slack to include team members from the client so as to reduce the amount of time in meetings.  

## Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.

### It focuses the team on the task at hand and makes it clear what things need to get done to move on to the next sprint.

## What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?

###  Good service Cheap won't be Fast, Good service Fast won't be Cheap, Fast service Cheap won't be Good  Whichever side of the triange you are on, you will be lacking in one area whether that be service, speed, or expense.  You need to understand the concept in order to have realistic expectations of the team so that you can negotiate well with the client about the results they can expect to receive.
