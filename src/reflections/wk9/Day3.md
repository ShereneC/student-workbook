# Tres Dia Capstones

Today's Reflection: John and I are finishing up the my garden page today.  Still not happy about the plants being found by creator id, but we need to move on.  

## How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team? / What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

### You might need to widen the scope of your communication on slack to include team members from the client so as to reduce the amount of time in meetings.  / An image that is turned into 64bit code instead of 0s & 1s.

## Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

### It focuses the team on the task at hand and makes it clear what things need to get done to move on to the next sprint.  / It can make the file a little bit bigger and use up more bandwith on heavy image sites - also can't be cached and the website has to do a server call each time you go to the site.

## What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?  /  Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

###  Good service Cheap won't be Fast, Good service Fast won't be Cheap, Fast service Cheap won't be Good  Whichever side of the triange you are on, you will be lacking in one area whether that be service, speed, or expense.  You need to understand the concept in order to have realistic expectations of the team so that you can negotiate well with the client about the results they can expect to receive.  /Used to need a seperate route for images, but now routes have been improved and images can be retrieved along with data.
