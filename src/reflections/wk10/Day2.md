# Dos Dia - INTRODUCTION TO DOTNET WEBAPI'S

Today's Reflection: Mark made the PetShopApi today.  This showed us how to use dotnet with C#. We were tasked with using C# to create the GregsList application.  I was able to get the back-end functions completed for cars.

## What is a List in C#?

### List is a collection of items of a generic type.

## What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

### I think list.add will be used a lot as apps will need to add items to the list.  List.Find will also be used a lot to see if a particular item is contained in a list. 

## How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

### Use List.Find.  Tell it what you're looking through, what specific and what exact condition you are wanting to find.
