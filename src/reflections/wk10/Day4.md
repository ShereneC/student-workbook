# Cuatro Dia BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH MYSQL & AUTH0

Today's Reflection: Mark built out the Tower project today which was a site for listing concerts and events.  He did all the back-end functions in sql, but ran out of time for the edit function, so we don't really have a good example of that one.  Our assignment was AllSpice REcipes - build out the recipes and their backend functions, then create steps for each of the recipes.  It took a while to get auth setup to be able to get a token.  But it is always great to work with Amanda, she will be an amazing dev!

## What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

### An enum is a constant that is strongly typed that is arranged in a list or something that can be iterated over.  You can use an enum when you have a list of a type of somethings, but maybe you don't exactly know if it is a list or an array, so you can call it by ienumerable.

## How can you modify an Enum?

### You have to modify the base type and member values.

## How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

### We have used them interchangeably with Lists in our Get functions this week.  We can get all "cats" (for example) by calling IEnumerable<Cat>.  So you are enumerating over a list of Cat type objects.
