# Cinco Dia END Week 10

Today's Reflection: Today was awesome to have a lesson on interviewing from Brittany and then having an alumni panel to ask questions to during lunch.  Disappointed that we only had a short time to start on our blogger project.  I am having problems getting my own Auth0 account connected to my code, so hopefully I can figure that out.
