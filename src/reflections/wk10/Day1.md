# Uno Dia - Intro to C#

Today's Reflection: This looks like stuff we have done before, but I have spent so much time and energy into learning Vue, that I'm not sure how to do this organization scheme anymore.  But it seems straightforward enough.  Using the console, Mark made a list of dogs and cats that are available for adoption at the "Shelter."  The user is asked which kind of animal they want, and then the name of the animal.  Compared it to when we built classes over and over for the zoo assignment on week 3.

## What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
### Value type holds its own value within its own memory space, Reference type holds an address for where the value is being stored, Pointer type - not clear on this - something about it being an unmanaged type such as type* or void*.

## What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
### Bool, byte, enum, float, short, etc., etc.,.  It appears there are a lot more than we used in java and the numbers in particular have many different types where in java they were just an int.

## In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
### Value types hold their own value and can then be passed around in methods.  Reference types such as strings and arrays occupy a specific spot in memory and their location is passed around in methods so as not to have to pass the whole thing around as it can be large.
