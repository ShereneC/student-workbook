# Cinco Dia 

Today's Reflection: I think my biggest struggle this week has been getting external sources into your code like design icons and font awesome. I'm completely lost on setting up your own color palettes.  I hope to get help on that during tutoring this coming week.  I think I am getting a better handle on using flex box design after this week's checkpoint.  My knowledge of it is quite fragile though, I need to keep practicing it to really get it down.  It is interesting that though I am done with the checkpoint, if I had to do it all again, there are several things I would do differently now that I know how things work a little bit more.
