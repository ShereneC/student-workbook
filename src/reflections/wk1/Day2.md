# Dos Dia - Environment Setup

Today's Reflection: During webpage construction, there are a lot of small details that I never though about before - padding on the left, how about on the right, what about a margin?  So many little things that add up to make a big difference in the overall readability and appearance of your website.  Using html & CSS today, I don't feel like I have even scratched the surface. 

## What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

### There wasn't too much on pseudo classes in the reading.  It just said that some are worth 1 pt and others are worth 10 pts.  It looks like the one we would use most frequently is :hover.

## What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

### Specificity is the level at which certain styles are applied to objects.  The higher the specificity of a style, then that is the style that is put on the object.  An inline specificity trumps all others.  To use specificity to my benefit, I need to learn the correct heierarchy and use css to apply styles to common features on my web pages. 

## What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

### It seems like there is a better way to style an element than by using the important feature.  You might create classes expecting them to change styles, but due to !important, the classes wouldn't appear to be working.  I would need to see an example of why it would need to be used.
