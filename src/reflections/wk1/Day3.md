# Tres Dia - Building with Bootstrap

Today's Reflection: I was comfortable learning CSS and applying styles that way.  Bootstrap shook my brain up.  I see the simplicity of having all those preset properties, it will just take time to learn how to apply them.  I had to start with the beginner challenge, but I was able to get it done, although I have many questions.



## What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

### Best tip is that you don't have to be a professional designer to add a little some'in some'in to your pages - like a colorful border on one side.

## Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

### https://dribbble.com/shots, https://heroicons.com/, https://ianstormtaylor.com/design-tip-never-use-black/ 

## How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

###  Through good design you can display competence, professionalism, and quality.  When a website is clunky, lack-luster and difficult to navigate, users will go somewhere else.  Draw people in with a great design!
