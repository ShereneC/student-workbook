# Cuatro Dia 

Today's Reflection: Given time, I see the value of a design program such as figma. Despite my lack of sketching ability, it is so much more efficient for me to sketch out a wireframe on paper.  I did take the time to design a figma for today's partner project - as a result, we did not complete the project.



## What is the purpose of wire-framing?

### Wire-framing allows you to have a plan for all the pieces of code needed on your website before you start coding.  It is a rough-draft of the design of your code.

## What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful? 

### Low-mid-high fidelity.  Each one is useful as you make necessary modifications as you move from low to high ensuring that your final product has been well thought out and tested.

## Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

### When the stakes are high - absolutely!  It would be important to have wireframes to show to a client you are building a site for.  The wireframes allow you to get feedback and make changes without manipulating code.  You will move forward with an agreed-upon wireframe.  Then the coding begins.
