# Cinco Dia End Week 11

Today's Reflection: The final project was explained to us today and we had time to get a good start on it.  Of course I am nervous about trying to get it all done. I've worked very hard to understand things, I've done extra tutoring, and at this point all I can do is my best.  I was only able to get the CRUD methods working for "keeps" during class today.  I'm frustrated that I spent almost an hour trying to figure out why the un-authorized tests weren't passing.  I had to get a TA to come help.  Turned out to be something wrong with the tokens I had in Postman.  The thought had briefly crossed my mind earlier, but I know I had done that right, so I didn't bother trying to redo that.  Grrr.....
