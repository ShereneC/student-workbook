# Cuatro Dia Full-Stack Review

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your final project, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point:  

Wow, it has been a rollercoaster!  There have been many times when I have just been overwhelmed at the expectations and the amount of information coming my way.  A few times I have felt comfortable and impressed with myself for the things I have learned.  I really enjoyed the capstone project with my teammates.  That was the first time that I felt like I was really beginning to understand Vue.  As we head into the final tomorrow, I am most concerned about having to write a full stack app on my own and it feels like forever since I was working in the front end!  The review today was very helpful and I am hopeful that I can get this done.
