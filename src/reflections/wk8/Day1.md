# Uno Dia - Checkpoint the BugLog

Today's Reflection: Working on the BugLog today.  Hoping to get it all done and working by tomorrow morning, 9am!!

## What function does a developer Portfolio provide?
### It shows off your abilities and skill set; it also gives you the opportunity to increase your skills.  

## What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?
### Having good examples of your work - do not post things on your portfolio that are ugly or slow.  Invest in a hosting site so that your portfolio pieces are fast and professional.

## What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?
### I would like to fix up the Network and the Buglog and put those in my portfolio.
