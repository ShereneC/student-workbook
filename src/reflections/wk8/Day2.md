# Dos Dia - Capstone 

Today's Reflection: Unfortunately, I spent the day working on the Bug Log as I received 17/20 and I needed 18/20 to pass.  I only needed to fix one thing, but I wanted to fix it all so that there was no chance of it not passing tomorrow.  I spent most of the day on it and missed out on planning with my group for the capstone project.  I ended up receiving 19/20 on the regrade.  I'm not sure what I missed as I thought I had it all completed, but at least I passed.

## Why is communication on a small team important?

### It's always important to have good communication on a team, the problem with a small team, is that there are fewer memebers to spread out the meetings to, so "all-hands-on-deck" meetings happen too often and it prevents work from moving forward quickly.  What is needed is a communication platform like Slack that can keep everyone abreast of what is going on without having to schedule frequent, long meetings.

## What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

### Keep expectations reasonable, be aware of the unattainable triangle.  Be flexible in helping with the front-end or back-end.  Keep communication open through slack.

## What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

### The unattainable triangle:  Good service Cheap won't be Fast, Good service Fast won't be Cheap, Fast service Cheap won't be Good  Whichever side of the triange you are on, you will be lacking in one area whether that be service, speed, or expense.  Is there any way to hang out in the middle of the triangle?
