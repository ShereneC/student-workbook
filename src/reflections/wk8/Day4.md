# Cuatro Dia Capstone Project

Today's Reflection: We split up into partners today to start working on the code.  CJ and I completed the server-side for Questions.  We ran into some hiccups that had to be fixed, so we did not get the comments completed as planned.  We are trying to understand the correct way to branch and pull/push so as not to lose information or create conflicts.  Jake came in at the end of the day and explained to us that we need to create a branch called the system we are working on and then push it up to main and delete the branch.  That way we know what is being worked on and how long it is taking to work on each part.  We will do that tomorrow.

## What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

### Unit testing allows you to test small parts of your code. Component testing allows you to test whole components, but they must be mounted to the DOM (real or virtual). End2End testing tests the whole application - time consuming.

## What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

### Aren't they all needed?  You test the individual parts as you go along.  I guess if I had to choose, it would be end 2 end.  You cannot put an application out there for people to use unless it has been wholly tested and verified as complete.

## What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

### I don't think any of them would be least useful.  Aren't they all important?  You need to test each small piece, then larger pieces, then the whole thing.  Are you asking about the different frameworks?
