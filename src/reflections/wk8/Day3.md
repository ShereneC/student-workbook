# Tres Dia

Today's Reflection:  Finished the bulk of planning today and we started coding.  John is working on hard-coding about 15 plants into the database because we cannot find a working api for plants.  We made a trello board, figma mock-up, and lucid chart detailing relationships.


## What is Software Development Testing?

### Building tests for small parts of code to test in isolation before going to production.

## What are the benefits of Testing in software development?
### If you test each part, then when you put things together, you will know which parts are not the problem, as they have already passed the tests.

## What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?

### It can take additional time and effort, but done correctly, it is worth it.
