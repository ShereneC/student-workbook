# Cinco Dia Capstone Project - GreenThumb

Today's Reflection: Morning stand-up- we reviewed what we got done yesterday.  John worked on the hardcoding plants into the database.  We have 18 plants.  Shanker & Jarom worked on the garden model and many to many relationship between the garden and the plants.  CJ and I completed the backend for the posts.  We talked about what we will be working on for the next sprint.  CJ and I completed the comments backend.  There's some confusion on the plantGarden many to  many.  Hopefully we can clear it up quickly on Monday.
