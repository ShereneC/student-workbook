# Cuatro Dia Checkpoint

Today's Reflection: We worked hard today.  However, at every turn we found new problems.  For example when we created tasks, they were only being created on the first backlog on the list.  We had to get help several times.  We are not very close to being done and we only have a couple hours tomorrow to finish.  I am hoping we can get the rest done quickly.  

## Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

### We have tried to create a friendly UX this week.  While we have talked about what is happening with our code, we do need to make more comments in it.

## What went well?

### I have an amazing partner who has a natural talent for coding and understanding the processes involved.  She helped guide this project to completion.

## What would you do differently?

### I would like to have been better at navigating, but feel inadequate.  I have reached out for extra tutoring and am hoping it will help me feel more confident.
