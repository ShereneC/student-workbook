# Cuatro Dia Checkpoint

Today's Reflection:

## Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

### We have tried to create a friendly UX this week.  While we have talked about what is happening with our code, we do need to make more comments in it.

## What went well?

### I have an amazing partner who has a natural talent for coding and understanding the processes involved.  She helped guide this project to completion.

## What would you do differently?

### I would like to have been better at navigating, but feel inadequate.  I have reached out for extra tutoring and am hoping it will help me feel more confident.
