# Tres Dia - Checkpoint

Today's Reflection: Today we were able to get the Projects Page done and have it connect to the backend with a Create button.  Design took a bit longer than it should have - we were having bootstrap difficulties.  But we should be able to get the rest of our gets and puts done quickly since we have our project working.
