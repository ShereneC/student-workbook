# Cinco Dia CHECKPOINT END WEEK 7

Today's Reflection: We finished our Sprintr project in the morning.  This was a tough project. The relationships were not straight forward to me. The task may or may not belong to a sprint, and it can switch from one sprint to another.  My partner is responsible for making all this code actually work.  I am slowly beginning to understand the organization process of vue.  I do not like it.  Is there a different framework I might click with better?
