# Uno Dia - Intro to JavaScript

Today's Reflection: Enjoyed learning about the functionality of javascript and how it can add interactivity to a website.

## What is Scope ?
### Scope is the area of code that objects or variables exist in.  They might be global or inside a function.

## What is Hoisting ?
### Hoisting is putting a variable up at the top of its scope - it is undefined, then will be defined some time during the function or scope.  Hoisting it makes it so that it can be changed, but can also give unintended consequences.

## In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
### I am confused between let & var.  It seems like let is only used within the scope of a function and var is a more global variable?  const is a variable that does not change - for example pi.
