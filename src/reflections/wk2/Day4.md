# Cuatro Dia 

Today's Reflection:  Working with Shanker on the SlapGame today was fun, but also frustrating.  I'm struggling with knowing when/how to pass a real variable or use an arbitrary word to pick it up.  When can I use the same name for a variable and when can I not?  Hmmm.....

## What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

### Making a wireframe allows you to know exactly what html/css code you need in place before you start working on your interactive (js) code.  

## How do you find answers when you are stuck?

### I look through my notes, code completed by our teacher during lessons, google it, then ask one of the TAs.

## From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

### Once you become a real programmer - there are always ways to improve your skill.  Be considerate of others who will read your code, use best practices, leave code better than when you found it.
