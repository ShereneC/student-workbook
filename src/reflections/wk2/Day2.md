# Dos Dia - JAVASCRIPT FUNCTIONS, OBJECTS, AND LOOPS

Today's Reflection: I understand the concepts.  I am having a hard time putting them into the code and making them work.

## What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

### Function declcaration - hoisted can be used before defined (how does that work??????), function expression - not hoisted cannot be used before defined, arrow function - short way of writing a function expression.  

## What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

### Parameters are the type of thing that functions accept.  Arguments are the specific items passed into the function from the invocation.

## What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

### Higher order functions accept a function as a parameter and return a function.  An example is array.prototype.map
