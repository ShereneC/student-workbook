Today's Reflection: Feeling overwhelmed with objects and arrays, as there can be arrays of ojects, and vice versa - I think.  When to use the dot and when to use the brackets is stumping me.  There is also an occasion where you use the brackets, but it does not mean that you are referencing an array - yikes.
