# Tres Dia INTERACTING WITH THE DOM AND EVENTS

Today's Reflection: I understand the concepts of arrays, objects and dictionaries.  I am struggling with how to put the code together to access that data and perform tasks or functions with it.  I will keep working on it.  


## What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

### Putting console.log into your code will allow you to see the value of variables as you step through your code to help you debug any problems.  The console is also where error messages show up.  You can click on those error messages and get information on what is causing them.  Very helpful.

## Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

### I believe you are referring to the elements tab.  On this tab, you can hover over objects and their properties are displayed.  It helps you to see what properties you have put on things so that you can see why things are happening.  You can also alter things temporarily here just to try them out.

## Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

### Put the "debugger" in and then you can step through the code with it's help.
