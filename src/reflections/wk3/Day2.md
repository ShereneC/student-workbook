# Dos Dia - Encapsulation

Today's Reflection: All the different files are giving me whiplash.  I can follow along in class, but then trying to make working code during lab is difficult.  Using the template proved to be quite difficult - I did not understand what some of the things were for.  I might have been better off creating the files from scratch and using today's lesson as an example to move forward.

## What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

### Grouping together like functions makes code more organized and readable.

## What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

### Not sure I undestand what closures are - a function that gets created at the call of the function?  So a function inside itself?  But the underscore has become a more accepted practice of making private functions, although it seems to make change states more difficult?

## How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

### Everything created using modules is private -to expose things you need to "export" them.  Do this to prevent users from accessing your direct code -they can have copies of it for manipulation - such as by proxy, but they cannot directly access the object.
