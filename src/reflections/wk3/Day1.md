# Uno Dia - Intro to Asynchronous Code

Today's Reflection: Using classes is a way to group like things and organize the code.  As code gets more involved, it helps to have classes on their individual files.  This also prevents access to information that they shouldn't have access to.  You just have to make sure that what is needed by the program is imported/exported correctly.

## What problem does using exports solve?
### This allows "encapsulation" which protects part of your code from being accessed when it shouldn't be.

## How does export differ from export default?
### Export default sends the default if nothing else is specifically exported. 

## What is a benefit of using the Module System?
### Module allows you to connect files together without putting script tags in for each one.  If you use script tags, you have to make sure you put them in the correct order or they will not work.  Module elminates that problem.
