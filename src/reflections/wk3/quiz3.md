# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern

**1.** What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?

MVC - Model View Controller??
```
**2.** How would you access the `name` of the below object using the `property` variable?
```js

  job: "Code Monkey"
  }
let property = 'name'
```
staff.property   or staff[property]  ??? not sure
```

```
**3.** What is Encapsulation?
```
Grouping like things together utilizing separate files for those things.

**5.** What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?

A class holds all of the structure of what an instance of the class will be like.  For example, the idea you have of a chair, and an actual chair.
```
**6.** What is a `Proxy` object?

A copy of the object that can be manipulated in the code so as not to affect the original.
```

**7.** What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
To encapsulate and keep the code organized
```
**8.** What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Controller is the middle-man to take code from DOM and user and pass it to the services so data can be manipulated.
```

**9.** What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Service is where most of the action like functions happen.
```
**10.** What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

Model is the Class - you set up what an instance of that class will be like in the model file.
```
