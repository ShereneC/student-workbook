# Cuatro Dia Timeouts Intervals & Local Storage

Today's Reflection: I felt more inadequate than ever during partner projects today.  My partner was great, but her brain works much differently than mine. I need time to process these connections and when to use app. vs. proxystate.  Harrison walked me through making the connections during a tutoring session today and encouraged me to console log each step of the way to test for connectivity.  I am going to try that on tomorrow's checkpoint.

## What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

### The observer pattern helps to keep many elements in sync with the same data.

## What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

### Arrange Act Assert

## Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

### The template allows you to create numerous classes, services, controllers, and connect all through the appstate/proxystate.
