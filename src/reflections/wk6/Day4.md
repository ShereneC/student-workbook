Amanda and I worked together on the Blog site where we retrieved blog posts from the sandbox, displayed them on the home page, and they were assigned with a creatorId.

## What is a nested route?

### Nested route is needed for components that are nested inside each other.  There will be links to subpages.

## When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

### When one page takes you to another.  For example, if you click on a planet and it gives you an info page, then you could click on each of the planets moons and it will take you to another page. 

## Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

### Yes, you can pass through parameters such as id, then you could display all posts that were created by the profile id.
