# Uno Dia - INTRODUCTION TO VUEJS

Today's Reflection: We were introduced to Vue today.  It allows you to write a lot of inline code and not have to pass things through controllers, services, appstates, etc.  It seems simple enough - but it is only day 1. Hahahahaha!
Concepts:
Intro to Vue
v-if, v-else,
v-show,
v-for (loops)
state was a single object, then turned into an array of objects
@click - now using instead of onclick
computed (method/function that calculated if all were dead)

## What is Component based architecture?
### Each feature of the page is its own component and can be worked on independently from another.  

## What are some benefits of Component based architecture?
### One component can refresh without having to refresh other components. Components contain all their features within a single class.  Components are reuseable.

## What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?
### It can degrade readability
