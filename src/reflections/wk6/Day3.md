# Tres Dia SIMULATING MULTIPLE PAGES WITH THE VUE ROUTER

Today's Reflection:
Used Greg's list to practice using the api with Vue and use router links to take us to a page designated for the active car. We created CarCard, CarForm, components and a CarDetails page.  They say vue is much easier, but so far it seems like their are even more files than MVCS to pass things between.  When something is not working, it is more difficult to go find what the problem is than it was before.  We now have to use Vue tools in the inspector, but also the old tools, so we are switching between tools a lot.

## What are lifecycle hooks? What are lifecycle hooks used for?

### "Lifecycle hooks are a window into how the library you're using works behind-the-scenes. Lifecycle hooks allow you to know when your component is created, added to the DOM, updated, or destroyed."

## How have you utilized lifcycle hooks in your afternoon projects?
### We have not been using such hooks as beforeUpdate, beforeMount.  We have used mounted and it is my understanding that this is needed for it to go get information from the api as soon as the page is rendered.  Mark has not spoken about lifecycle hooks.

## What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?

### They are used in the setup of a page and I believe they tell the page what to do as soon as the page is rendered.
