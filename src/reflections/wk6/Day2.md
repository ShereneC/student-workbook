# Dos Dia - VUE COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE

Today's Reflection: I am confused with the new structure of passing things around in vue.  Mick taught us how to use vue to capture a list of movies using a keyword query and have them show up and then choose an active movie to have the information of just that movie highlighted. https://github.com/MickShannahan/ls2021vueflix 
Concepts:
AppState
Axios
Api
Query
props - he did this at the end and I did not understand it at all.


## What are props?

### data that flows from a parent to a child like a variable

## What are props used for?

### passing variables or properties?

## Where can props be used or accessed?

### They can be bound inside the html template
